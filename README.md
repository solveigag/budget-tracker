# BUDGET TRACKER

## JavaScript MasterClass course project No.3

This application was built following JavaScript MasterClass [course](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/javascript-masterclass/9781837637904/9781837637904-video13_1/). 

The aim of the project was to learn more about accessing elements in the DOM and data from a form, as well as utilising local storage and working with dates.

The user can add transactions (income or an expense that should be entered as a negative number) that are stored in the local storage. When user clicks to delete a transaction it is also removed from local storage. Users are also able to track their balance as well as totals for income and expenses. Users are unable to submit empty values - an error message will propmt to check inputs, but will disappear for a field that receives some input.
